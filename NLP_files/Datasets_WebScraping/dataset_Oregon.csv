      The Data Engineer will play a crucial role in advancing the CDC Foundation's mission by designing, building, and maintaining modern data infrastructure for the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) Environmental Public Health Division. This role is aligned to the Workforce Acceleration Initiative (WAI). WAI is a federally funded CDC Foundation program with the goal of helping the nation’s public health agencies by providing them with the technology and data experts they need to accelerate their information system improvements.

           Lane Community College is a learning-centered community college that provides affordable, quality, lifelong educational opportunities.  History
         
         
          Lane Community College was founded in 1964 by a vote of local citizens, and the main campus opened in 1968. The college was a successor to the Eugene Technical-Vocational School that was founded in 1938. Lane Community College has received many awards and accolades for its innovative programs and high-quality instruction. The college is a member of the League for Innovation in the Community College.
         
         
         
           One of the advantages of working at Lane Community College is living in the area. Lane Community college’s main campus is in Eugene, a city known for its quality of life and for being the home of the University of Oregon. Eugene is home to more than 153,000 people and neighboring Springfield has more than 57,000 residents comprising the second-largest population center in the state. Eugene and Springfield are nestled in the Willamette Valley between the Pacific Ocean and the Cascade Mountains. Some peaks in the Cascade Range can be seen from the main campus. The area’s scenic mountains, forests, rivers, lakes, and coastline offer many opportunities for outdoor adventures or for just sitting back and enjoying the view.

         </div>
         <div>
          Lane Community College was founded in 1964 by a vote of local citizens, and the main campus opened in 1968. The college was a successor to the Eugene Technical-Vocational School that was founded in 1938. Lane Community College has received many awards and accolades for its innovative programs and high-quality instruction. The college is a member of the League for Innovation in the Community College.

          <br> One of the advantages of working at Lane Community College is living in the area. Lane Community college’s main campus is in Eugene, a city known for its quality of life and for being the home of the University of Oregon. Eugene is home to more than 153,000 people and neighboring Springfield has more than 57,000 residents comprising the second-largest population center in the state. Eugene and Springfield are nestled in the Willamette Valley between the Pacific Ocean and the Cascade Mountains. Some peaks in the Cascade Range can be seen from the main campus. The area’s scenic mountains, forests, rivers, lakes, and coastline offer many opportunities for outdoor adventures or for just sitting back and enjoying the view.

   Position Announcement
  We enthusiastically seek an established interdisciplinary scholar to work with us in building and guiding our newly established Department of Data Science, as Department Head. We invite applications from researchers working in Data Science, broadly defined, including those who contribute to data analysis methodology for applied domain(s), as well as those whose research focuses directly on the methodology itself (e.g., computer science, statistics, or applied math). We are building the Data Science department to center justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion (JDEI), in our department's research, teaching, and organization. Strong faculty candidates will therefore have demonstrated impactful contributions to JDEI. We encourage applications from candidates with a history of collaboration with domain experts.  The department head will work with an engaged and collaborative faculty to build a supportive department that makes positive and impactful contributions to the University, to the public of Oregon, and to the globe. To do so, the head will identify strategic opportunities for our growing department that guide future faculty hiring, foster and support the department's faculty in research excellence, and continues to expand our educational mission at the undergraduate and graduate level. The head will also work with the Executive Director of the newly formed School of Computer and Data Science on active outreach to diversify admissions, and to develop internship and other programs to aid graduates in career placement. The joint administrative and academic position is based at the University of Oregon’s main campus in Eugene, Oregon, and will be appointed as a tenured full professor in the Department of Data Science. The standard term of Department Head is three years, with possibility of renewal.  Strong candidates will have demonstrated their ability and vision for building positively engaged spaces, programs, or organizations. Strong candidates will also have a history of excellent research scholarship; as befits an inclusive, interdisciplinary department, we are open to various metrics of research success beyond grants, citations, and publications (including policy impact, community engagement in research, collaborative projects, et cetera). Strong candidates will also have demonstrated excellence in and commitment to teaching, translation of knowledge, or advising/mentoring of students (including out-of-classroom education). We are excited to grow a mutually supportive culture of impactful teaching and research in our new department. We welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing members of groups who have been historically excluded from data science and higher education (as evidenced by life experiences and educational background), and who have experience in JDEI with respect to teaching, mentoring, research, outreach, life experiences, or service towards building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment.  More information about the Data Science department can be found at https://scds.uoregon.edu/ds. Particular strengths of collaborative research at UO include astronomy, biomedical data science, cell and developmental biology, data ethics, earth science, ecology, education, environmental science, evolution, linguistics, neuroscience, physics, spatial information sciences and sport and wellness, although we welcome applicants from other disciplines.
   Department or Program Summary
  Data Science is a new department that has grown out of a long-standing initiative to increase scholarship and education in quantitative methodology at the University of Oregon. We envision the Data Science Department to be a hub of ethical methodological data science research, with strong connections to domain areas of application, overall facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration across the university. Current faculty and affiliates reflect strengths in machine learning, biological modeling, data ethics, data sovereignty, computer science, environmental data science, climate change policy and modeling, evolutionary genetics, and forensic genetics. The University of Oregon is a public university committed to exceptional teaching, discovery, and service, with a mission to foster the next generation of transformational leaders and informed participants in the global community. The department offers a rapidly growing Data Science undergraduate program, offered for the first time in Fall 2020 and projected to have >700 undergraduate majors in 2027. This program aims to help students learn the technical data science skills to do socially/environmentally-connected interdisciplinary work with real world impact.  Faculty in the Department of Data Science can work with PhD students and integrate in specialized research communities through affiliations with world-class research Institutes on campus (e.g., the Institute of Neuroscience; the Institute of Ecology and Evolution; Center for the Study of Women in Society).  Junior faculty in Data Science will be supported through the transition to tenure, including reduced service expectations, access to training in teaching through the Teaching Engagement Program, and faculty mentors to support building a research program. The Data Science department invests in the success of each new member and seeks to support faculty in successful and impactful careers while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
   Minimum Requirements
  
   PhD in a discipline related to data science (ex: statistics, computer science, applied mathematics, or a domain field with strong involvement in data science methodology applied in that field)
   Evidence of strong leadership service
   Appointable to the rank of Full Professor upon initiation of the position.
  
   Preferred Qualifications
  
   Demonstrated success in collaboratively building organized spaces of inclusive excellence
   Exemplary evidence of a commitment to advancing justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion through research, teaching, and service
   Demonstrated experience leading a productive and impactful research program aligned with the goals of the department.
  
   About the University
  The University of Oregon is dedicated to the goal of building a culturally diverse and pluralistic faculty committed to teaching and working in a multicultural environment. The Department of Data Science aims to be a feminist and anti-racist organization centering JDEI and research excellence, for instance as reflected in our faculty review criteria. All faculty are expected to deeply understand the barriers faced by members of groups which have been historically excluded from data science and/or academia. We strongly encourage applications from scholars from historically excluded or targeted groups, including historically excluded racial or ethnic groups; women, transgender, and non-binary scholars; scholars with disabilities; and LGBTQAI+ scholars.  The University of Oregon is one of only two Pacific Northwest members of the Association of American Universities and holds the distinction of a ""very high research activity"" ranking in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The UO enrolls more than 20,000 undergraduate and 3,600 graduate students representing all 50 states and nearly 100 countries. The UO's 295-acre campus features state-of-the art facilities in an arboretum-like setting within the traditional homelands of the Kalapuya people in the Willamette river valley. The UO is located in Eugene, a vibrant city of over 175,000 within easy driving distance of the Pacific Coast, the Cascade Mountains, and Portland.

  ABOUT THE ROLE  At 3Degrees, we are committed to advancing a decarbonized future.

Your responsibilities will revolve around developing innovative forecasting tools, translating complex datasets into actionable insights, and playing a crucial role in shaping trading strategies. Your expertise will go beyond supporting the trading desk—you'll challenge conventional thinking, identify strategic gaps, and introduce innovative solutions to improve our trading performance.

Highly qualified candidates located within a commutable distance to our San Francisco, CA, Portland, OR, and New York, NY offices will also be considered. 3Degrees does not provide sponsorship and /or relocation assistance for non-nationals in any of our roles.
