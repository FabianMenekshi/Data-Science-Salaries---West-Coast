   About the University and Department:
  Boise State University has made a significant investment in the growth of the Department of Computer Science, with eighteen new faculty hires, a new building downtown, and several new undergraduate and graduate programs at both the Masters and Ph.D. levels, including programs in Cybersecurity, Data Science, Computer Science, and CMSE. This investment has enabled the department to more than triple in size over the last six years to 26 faculty (18 tenure-track) with 100+ graduates each year and 20-30 MS/PhD graduates each year. .
  Undergraduate enrollment has increased to around 700 students at present. New undergraduate degrees in Computer Science have been created with emphasis areas in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Secondary Education, and Entrepreneurship. A new interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Computing program was started in 2016, which has quickly grown to be the largest PhD program at Boise State with 68 students, and with faculty participation from a multitude of departments across campus. Eighteen Ph.D. students have graduated and accepted research or academic positions in industry and universities.
  The College of Engineering and Department of Computer Science have a strong record of providing support and mentoring for early career faculty, and a number of resources that can be provided to assist early career faculty in establishing funded research programs. In the last several years new faculty have been very successful in obtaining external funding, with six Computer Science faculty members receiving NSF CAREER awards, and several other faculty receiving large grants from various funding agencies.
  The department is a critical part of the vibrant software and high-tech industry in the Boise metropolitan area, with close relationships with tech companies and a strong and active industry advisory board. In 2016 the department moved to a new building located in the heart of downtown Boise – within walking distance to dozens of software companies but still close to the main campus. The department’s location in the heart of downtown allows faculty and students to interact frequently with the ever-growing number of local software companies. Furthermore, the department has close relationships with Idaho’s K-12 school system and has been instrumental in developing and establishing K-12 computer science curriculum and standards, as well as establishing and supporting K-12 teacher training programs.
  Boise State University is the largest university in Idaho, with an enrollment of approximately 25,000 students, and has the largest Computer Science department in the state. The university is located in Idaho’s capital city and largest metropolitan area, serving as the state's government, business, high-tech, economic, and cultural center. Boise offers a great quality of life: a family-friendly culture, a vibrant downtown, and great outdoor recreation including skiing, rafting, camping, hiking, fishing, and biking. To further enhance the quality of life Boise offers, the university has committed to sustaining the conditions necessary for faculty to enter and thrive in their academic careers while meeting personal and family responsibilities.
  We’re building a thriving community of faculty and staff whose unique skills, experiences, and perspectives come together to create a rich and rewarding academic experience. Applications from all backgrounds are welcomed. Learn more about faculty careers at Boise State and the City of Boise.

      Quarterly ""Work Wherever"" allowance

      Open concept office with friendly coworkers
      Creative environment where you can make a difference

"IIX Global","Open Position: Product Growth Head, IIX Platforms
 Impact Investment Exchange (IIX (https://iixglobal.com/)) is a pioneer in the global impact investing movement, dedicated to reshaping finance for sustainable development with a focus on gender equality and climate action through capital mobilization and data-based solutions. For over a decade and a half, we've been building the sustainable investing market, from establishing the world's largest crowdfunding platform for impact investing (Impact Partners (http://impactpartners.iixglobal.com/)™), operating award-winning enterprise technical assistance programs, creating innovative financial products such as the Women's Livelihood Bond™ Series (https://wlb.iixglobal.com/), (listed 6 bonds in the public market with zero credit default) and establishing an Impact Institute (https://institute.iixglobal.com/) and Research & Advisory (https://iixglobal.com/research-and-insights/). While we are very deep with our work in Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, our work spans 60 countries globally where we have invested close to $500 million of private-sector capital, positively impacted over 160 million direct and household lives, and avoided over 1.9 million metric tons of carbon and have collected over 90,000+ data points on sustainable micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The base of IIX's work is IIX Values (https://iixvalues.com/)™, an impact verification tech solution measuring investments' social and environmental impact to the last mile, amplifying the voices of the underserved. In 2022, we, along with global partners, launched the Orange Movement™ (https://orangemovement.global/) and, within that, created a new asset class, Orange Bond (https://orangemovement.global/orange-bonds), to demonstrate the intersectionality of gender equality and climate action and unlock $10 billion in capital markets by 2030, impacting 100 million women, girls, and gender minorities and making them a key player in climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. In 2024, we unveiled our global data hub, IIX Intelligence (https://intelligence.iixvalues.com/)™, which aggregates, evaluates, and benchmarks data from sustainable MSMEs, offering unparalleled insights into gender diversity, climate action, ESG performance, and community risk management. IIX Intelligence demonstrates with data the importance of MSMEs as a backbone of sustainable development. Numerous accolades, including the Oslo Business for Peace and the UN Global Climate Action Award, have recognized our efforts.

"IIX Global","About IIX:
 Impact Investment Exchange (IIX) is a pioneer in the global impact investing movement, dedicated to reshaping finance for sustainable development with a focus on gender equality and climate action through capital mobilization and data-based solutions. For over a decade and a half, we've been building the sustainable investing market, from establishing the world's largest crowdfunding platform for impact investing (Impact Partners™), operating award-winning enterprise technical assistance programs, creating innovative financial products such as the Women's Livelihood Bond™ Series, (listed 6 bonds in the public market with zero credit default) and establishing an Impact Institute and Research & Advisory. While we are very deep with our work in Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, our work spans 60 countries globally where we have invested close to $500 million of private-sector capital, positively impacted over 160 million direct and household lives, and avoided over 1.9 million metric tons of carbon and have collected over 90,000+ data points on sustainable micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The base of IIX's work is IIX Values™, an impact verification tech solution measuring investments' social and environmental impact to the last mile, amplifying the voices of the underserved. In 2022, we, along with global partners, launched the Orange Movement™ and, within that, created a new asset class, Orange Bond, to demonstrate the intersectionality of gender equality and climate action and unlock $10 billion in capital markets by 2030, impacting 100 million women, girls, and gender minorities and making them a key player in climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. In 2024, we unveiled our global data hub, IIX Intelligence™, which aggregates, evaluates, and benchmarks data from sustainable MSMEs, offering unparalleled insights into gender diversity, climate action, ESG performance, and community risk management. IIX Intelligence demonstrates with data the importance of MSMEs as a backbone of sustainable development. Numerous accolades, including the Oslo Business for Peace and the UN Global Climate Action Award, have recognized our efforts. Our team's 'PREM' values—passion, resilience, equity, and mavericks—propel our efforts, bringing meaningful change to Global South communities and the 99%.
