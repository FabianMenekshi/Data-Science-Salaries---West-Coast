  Handle inbound requests from field teams for data analysis, data requests, and decision making support. Proactively work with internal stakeholders to prioritize needs and/or requests on a weekly basis.

  Own end-to-end problem solving efforts from the discovery & exploration phase through to implementation.
  Own an entire area of go-to-market operations that flexes depending on need and urgency (ability to consult across the business): taking projects from start to finish with high quality and impact, acting as the “subject-matter-expert”, and collaborating with stakeholders to ensure the analytics are being used to drive business outcomes
 
 What We’re Looking For On Your Resume
 
  3-7 years conducting data analysis and proven track record of those insights driving business impact
  3-7 years of designing and building dashboards used by large audiences for extended periods of time (Tableau preferred)

  Experience conducting innovative research in a business context
  Experience collaborating with systems and operations teams to fully operationalize insights and democratize data

"CSTE","Position type: Fellowship, full-time
Position Highlights
Location: Salt Lake City, Utah (hybrid or remote)
If relocation is not possible, we are open to supporting a fully remote work environment for the fellow. While employees are required to work 2 days a week in the office, our contractors have more flexibility and can work remotely from out of state.
Compensation: 95,000 plus benefits
Position Type: Full time, limited-term opportunity
Position End Date: June 14, 2025. Funding may be approved for up to 6 additional months beyond the stated project end date of June 14, 2025.
Position description: The Utah Department of Health and Human Services is a cabinet-level agency divided into three sections. Two sections administer public programs and services that address Healthcare Administration (such as Medicaid, Aging Services, Behavioral Health, and Services to People with Disabilities) and Community Health and Wellbeing (such as Child and Family Services, Juvenile Justice, Family Health, and Public Health). The third Operations Section, is where the fellow will be housed, and is supportive of the many programs and services administered by the other two sections. Some of the functions of the Operations Section include Finance, Public Affairs, Licensing, Customer Experience, Quality Improvement, Data Systems and Evaluation, and Legislative Affairs. Each section is separated into divisions according to statutory and administrative areas. The Fellow’s assignment is in the Division of Data Systems and Evaluation (DSE).
DSE serves the department, partner organizations, public health stakeholders, and individual Utahns by collecting, registering, securing, analyzing, and making available accurate vital records and health and human services data; and conducting public health and community health assessments to promote better outcomes. DSE consists of The Office of Informatics and Data Systems (OIDS), The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE), The Office of Vital Records and Statistics (OVRS), and The Office of Information Privacy and Security (IPS).
The DSE mission statement is that “internal and external stakeholders involved in the well-being of Utahns have equitable and timely access to accurate, protected, meaningful, and relevant population health, health care, vital records, and human services data and analytics.”
The Fellow will work specifically with the directors and staff of OIDS and ORE. Assignments in these offices are generally project-based. During the year, the Fellow will likely be assigned to work on several projects which are monitored using project management software. Most projects involve additional team members, stakeholders, and partners external to DHHS. Like most large post-pandemic organizations, Utah has leveraged technology to perform much of its work remotely. Utah agencies use a Google Platform for remote work. Utah has a centralized IT agency, the Division of Technology Services (DTS), that performs most technical functions including database administration, cloud services, and desktop support. Therefore, virtual meetings with DTS are several times each week often daily. Tasks will be identified every two to three weeks and documented in Jira. Completion of tasks are also transacted in Jira. Depending on the skills of the Fellow, the individual will perform various levels of technical functions including data extraction using SQL or Python, analyses using R and Excel, data visualizations using BI software. Soft skills are also valued and useful in meeting with system owners, users, and stakeholders to assess needs and to ensure projects meet deliverables and, most importantly, customer demand.
Preferred skills: R
Python
Power BI
Working with large datasets
Healthcare informatics
Public health informatics
Project management
Person matching
Application deadline: Application will remain open until funded positions are filled.

The Data Strategy fellows will play a critical role in advancing the goals of the CDC Public Health Data Strategy.
CSTE will review all completed fellow applications and conduct virtual interviews of fellow candidates. Accepted candidates will be matched to a State, Territorial, Local, or Tribal (STLT) health department host site, based on a mutual ranking process. Host site placements are limited to the approved host sites. Health departments interested in hosting a fellow will apply to CSTE through a separate application process. Remote, hybrid, and in-person placements may be available. As host sites are accepted, CSTE will make their position descriptions available to applicants.
CSTE is the sponsoring organization for this fellowship program, which is funded by the *CDC Foundation*. All host sites will be STLT health departments.

<p>Location: Salt Lake City, Utah (hybrid or remote)</p>
<p>If relocation is not possible, we are open to supporting a fully remote work environment for the fellow. While employees are required to work 2 days a week in the office, our contractors have more flexibility and can work remotely from out of state.</p>
<p>Compensation: 95,000 plus benefits</p>

<p>Position End Date: June 14, 2025. Funding may be approved for up to 6 additional months beyond the stated project end date of June 14, 2025.</p>
<p><b>Position description: </b>The Utah Department of Health and Human Services is a cabinet-level agency divided into three sections. Two sections administer public programs and services that address Healthcare Administration (such as Medicaid, Aging Services, Behavioral Health, and Services to People with Disabilities) and Community Health and Wellbeing (such as Child and Family Services, Juvenile Justice, Family Health, and Public Health). The third Operations Section, is where the fellow will be housed, and is supportive of the many programs and services administered by the other two sections. Some of the functions of the Operations Section include Finance, Public Affairs, Licensing, Customer Experience, Quality Improvement, Data Systems and Evaluation, and Legislative Affairs. Each section is separated into divisions according to statutory and administrative areas. The Fellow’s assignment is in the Division of Data Systems and Evaluation (DSE).</p>
<p>DSE serves the department, partner organizations, public health stakeholders, and individual Utahns by collecting, registering, securing, analyzing, and making available accurate vital records and health and human services data; and conducting public health and community health assessments to promote better outcomes. DSE consists of The Office of Informatics and Data Systems (OIDS), The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE), The Office of Vital Records and Statistics (OVRS), and The Office of Information Privacy and Security (IPS).</p>
<p>The DSE mission statement is that “internal and external stakeholders involved in the well-being of Utahns have equitable and timely access to accurate, protected, meaningful, and relevant population health, health care, vital records, and human services data and analytics.”</p>
<p>The Fellow will work specifically with the directors and staff of OIDS and ORE. Assignments in these offices are generally project-based. During the year, the Fellow will likely be assigned to work on several projects which are monitored using project management software. Most projects involve additional team members, stakeholders, and partners external to DHHS. Like most large post-pandemic organizations, Utah has leveraged technology to perform much of its work remotely. Utah agencies use a Google Platform for remote work. Utah has a centralized IT agency, the Division of Technology Services (DTS), that performs most technical functions including database administration, cloud services, and desktop support. Therefore, virtual meetings with DTS are several times each week often daily. Tasks will be identified every two to three weeks and documented in Jira. Completion of tasks are also transacted in Jira. Depending on the skills of the Fellow, the individual will perform various levels of technical functions including data extraction using SQL or Python, analyses using R and Excel, data visualizations using BI software. Soft skills are also valued and useful in meeting with system owners, users, and stakeholders to assess needs and to ensure projects meet deliverables and, most importantly, customer demand.</p>

"University of Utah","The College of Social and Behavioral Science at the University of Utah is seeking applicants for a Postdoctoral Research Associate with an interest in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to US Census data. AI is having far-reaching effects as it moves into everyday systems, such as healthcare, education, policy, immigration, and criminal justice, often with a focus on individualized outcomes. Interdisciplinary research is critical for developing “responsible” technologies that forward the public interest, recognizing AI as both a technological approach and a social practice (e.g. how humans are classified, how we identify technological problems, how we understand our society). Federal Statistical Research Data Centers, such as the Wasatch Front Research Data Center (WFRDC), located in the Interdisciplinary Exchange for Utah Science (NEXUS), offer a unique resource of census microdata, allowing the exploration of socio-demographic dynamics at an individual level, and there is a significant opportunity to apply AI methodologies to these data. We seek a researcher interested in developing research that integrates AI methods with the type of microdata held in the WFRDC. The successful candidate for this position will have a record of working with socio-demographic data and AI methods, and a commitment to responsible AI applications.
        
        
         Applicants should articulate a research plan that encompasses their own agenda and work with AI in ways that explicitly consider ethical implications. The research plan should involve analysis of census microdata at the WRFDC and the integration of other datasets (e.g. on redlining, mortgage lending, environmental exposures or health outcomes), and should reflect the specific research interests of the applicant. The selected applicant will join a collaborative team of geographers, sociologists, and other researchers using the WFRDC. Ideally, applicants will demonstrate interest in collaborations within the college and across campus. They will also have the opportunity to provide training for students interested in linking AI with, for example, research methods and ethics, policy applications, and social justice.

         The <b>College of Social and Behavioral Science</b> at the <b>University of Utah</b> is seeking applicants for a Postdoctoral Research Associate with an interest in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to US Census data. AI is having far-reaching effects as it moves into everyday systems, such as healthcare, education, policy, immigration, and criminal justice, often with a focus on individualized outcomes. Interdisciplinary research is critical for developing “responsible” technologies that forward the public interest, recognizing AI as both a technological approach and a social practice (e.g. how humans are classified, how we identify technological problems, how we understand our society). Federal Statistical Research Data Centers, such as the <b>Wasatch Front Research Data Center (</b><b>WFRDC</b><b>)</b>, located in the Interdisciplinary Exchange for Utah Science (NEXUS), offer a unique resource of census microdata, allowing the exploration of socio-demographic dynamics at an individual level, and there is a significant opportunity to apply AI methodologies to these data. We seek a researcher interested in developing research that integrates AI methods with the type of microdata held in the WFRDC. The successful candidate for this position will have a record of working with socio-demographic data and AI methods, and a commitment to responsible AI applications.<br>
        </div>
        <div>
         Applicants should articulate a research plan that encompasses their own agenda and work with AI in ways that explicitly consider ethical implications. The research plan should involve analysis of census microdata at the WRFDC and the integration of other datasets (e.g. on redlining, mortgage lending, environmental exposures or health outcomes), and should reflect the specific research interests of the applicant. The selected applicant will join a collaborative team of geographers, sociologists, and other researchers using the WFRDC. Ideally, applicants will demonstrate interest in collaborations within the college and across campus. They will also have the opportunity to provide training for students interested in linking AI with, for example, research methods and ethics, policy applications, and social justice.<br>

        Details
       
       
        
         The Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at the University of Utah is recruiting faculty members to lead cutting-edge research in clinical informatics and health data science while promoting and facilitating collaboration to impact lives daily and to address real-world problems.
        
        
         We are recruiting Assistant, Associate or Full Professors (Track and Rank commensurate with qualifications that includes the tenure-track) with demonstrated abilities in research. As part of DBMI’s Strategic Initiatives, the department plans to recruit over 7 new faculty members in 2023-2024. Candidates for this position should have research experience in clinical informatics and health data science. Experience at the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and prior funding with national funding agencies, such as NIH, DOD, AHRQ, HRSA, or NSF, is desirable. Candidates who are recipients of NSF or NIH career awards will be specially considered.
        
        
         Major responsibilities include maintaining an ambitious research program in health data science and clinical informatics that improve clinical processes or clinical care with informatics implementations. This research requires a high degree of inventiveness and a deep understanding of clinical data science or clinical process analytics. Alternatively, the research program could focus on developing methods to monitor clinical pathways and process execution that inform on clinical process improvement cycle. Energetic, self-directed individuals with a record of achievement and commitment to excellence in research, teaching, and the design and implementation of healthcare technologies are encouraged to apply.
        
        
         Prospective faculty will join a culture of collaborative and innovative research that crosses departments and schools within the University of Utah. Unique opportunities at the University of Utah include research on health care quality in a health system that has rated among the top 10 hospitals in the United States for a decade. Resources include the VA Informatics, Decision-Enhancement and Analytic Science (IDEAS) Center, a Health Services Research & Development-supported center housed at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System.
        
        
         Existing areas of strength at the University of Utah and VA Salt Lake City Health Care System include biomedical informatics, clinical and population health, decision support systems, medical decision making and patient preference assessment, survey research and measure development, data science, mixed methods, genomics, addiction medicine, neuroepidemiology, and infectious diseases.
        
        
         Candidates are expected to have a PhD degree from a quantitative field, such as Biomedical informatics, bioinformatics, computer science, engineering, computational biology, applied mathematics, statistics, applied physics, etc. Candidates with a professional doctoral degree (MD, PharmD, DNP, DDS, DO, etc.) are also welcomed to apply if they have a demonstrated track record in the relevant areas and have previous training in the quantitative fields listed above (e.g., post-doctoral degree in biomedical informatics). Candidates with a physician or nursing license in Utah can be co-appointed in a department of the School of Medicine and the School of Nursing. Candidates with a doctoral degree from other fields are required to have completed a post-doctoral degree in the quantitative fields listed above and a strong track record of publications in scientific, medical, and/or nursing journals. Publications of computational and/or informatics methods development or application is required (e.g., in computational biology, digital health, bioinformatics, and biomedical informatics journals). In addition, candidates must meet the University of Utah as well as the VA conditions of employment, such as U.S. Citizenship and screening for illegal drug use.
        
        
         The successful candidate is also expected to be embedded in an informatics data science R&D team at the VA, with the primary objective of mining VA data and developing innovative analytics that identify clinical informatics interventions that could further improve healthcare quality and efficiency. They will receive a start-up package and enjoy a stimulating, highly collaborative, and supportive research environment across multiple healthcare systems.

         Major responsibilities include maintaining an ambitious research program in health data science and clinical informatics that improve clinical processes or clinical care with informatics implementations. This research requires a high degree of inventiveness and a deep understanding of clinical data science or clinical process analytics. Alternatively, the research program could focus on developing methods to monitor clinical pathways and process execution that inform on clinical process improvement cycle. Energetic, self-directed individuals with a record of achievement and commitment to excellence in research, teaching, and the design and implementation of healthcare technologies are encouraged to apply.<br>
        </div>
        <div>
         Prospective faculty will join a culture of collaborative and innovative research that crosses departments and schools within the University of Utah.

"PassiveLogic","Digital Twin AI Framework Engineer 
 Are you looking for a career-defining challenge developing the world's first digital twin-AI standard for autonomous systems?
  What you will be doing:
 As the Digital Twin AI Framework Engineer, you will play a foundational role in our Digital Twins team in developing the descriptive language for Quantum.
 Quantum is a new digital twin-AI standard for defining autonomous systems. While other digital twin technologies provide labels for system components, Quantum takes digital twins further by defining both the existential nature of components and the relationships between them. By defining systems as digital twins in the form of a heterogeneous graph network, systems can become inference-able, introspect-able, and action-able. Learn more about Quantum here. 
 Responsibilities:
 
  Develop and evolve the Quantum digital twin object model, ontology, and API
  Develop the Quantum Knowability Model — evolve the formal proofs of digital twin definitions, systems, events, and compositional stage by which the formalisms can be known
  Support the development of the digital twin AI inferencing framework and the accelerator compute team
  Advocate for human-centered UX/UI at every stage of ontology development
