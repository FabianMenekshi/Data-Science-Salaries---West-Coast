  Job Description
 
 
  The Desert Research Institute's (DRI's) Division of Hydrologic Sciences is seeking a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in the general area of machine learning for spatial data analysis and uncertainty estimation. The successful candidate will immediately contribute their expertise to research on quantifying the spatial distribution of snow properties from point, airborne and satellite-based sensors. The successful candidate must have specialized skills in application of machine learning and statistical techniques to integration of spatial data obtained with different spatial support (e.g. point data with imagery) and uncertainty quantification to address environmental or earth science problems. Candidates that have experience in analyzing data collected in field campaigns are strongly encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to a growing range of programs at DRI focused on understanding and quantifying hydrologic systems and human impacts on those systems in the western US. This position can be located in either Reno, or Las Vegas, Nevada.
 
 
 
  Required Qualifications:
 
 
  Ph.D. from an accredited institution, with a focus on applying machine learning and statistical techniques to characterize and model environmental processes. Degrees in engineering, science, applied mathematics, statistics, computer science or other related fields
  Experience with analysis of spatial data using geostatistical, machine learning and/or Bayesian techniques
  Experience with machine learning techniques for classification, regression and probability density function estimation
  Experience expressing algorithms and workflows in Python
  Experience with analysis of field data in environmental and/or earth science research projects
  Ability to work independently to fulfill project goals and meet project deadlines;
  Effective verbal and written skills
  Effective interpersonal skills with a demonstrated ability to work and communicate effectively in small teams and work collegially in a group setting
 
 
 
  Preferred Qualifications:
 
 
  Experience with data collection in snow covered environments
  Experience with other supporting software: R, ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine
  Ability to translate research techniques from other fields to applications in snow science
  Demonstrated ability to develop oral/poster presentations and write peer-reviewed papers with limited supervision
  Experience in the development of research proposals
 
 
 
  Promotion Potential and Career Progression
 
 
  Postdocs and early career faculty are provided with considerable support and mentoring to give them every opportunity to be successful in a research career. A DRI postdoctoral research position has long served as the first step to a successful research career at DRI and at other institutions. Postdoctoral researchers hired from this posting may be eligible for promotion to regular faculty (Assistant Research Professor) upon the successful completion of their postdoc. To support the postdoc in working towards this goal, the DRI division the postdoc is hired under may provide professional development support for the incumbent to begin to develop their own research program as a postdoc. DRI postdocs are eligible to serve as PIs on research grants, and the incumbent will be encouraged to collaborate with colleagues across DRI and at other institutions. Promotion from Postdoctoral Researcher to Assistant Research Professor can occur when the Postdoctoral Researcher successfully demonstrates the ability to develop and sustain their own funding. The incumbent will also have the opportunity to participate in both formal and informal early career mentoring programs provided by DRI Human Resources. DRI faculty are supported through competitive grants and contracts with external funding agencies, and faculty therefore have access to considerable administrative support and an Institute-wide entrepreneurial approach to maintaining success in developing funding programs. DRI has been successful in using this model to create scientific breakthroughs and applied science solutions to some of the most challenging problems facing the nation and the world for over 60 years.
 
 
 
  DRI is a research-focused institution and teaching and advising of graduate students is not required but is possible through the Graduate Schools at UNR and UNLV.
 
 
 
  Salary / Benefits
 
 
  The minimum starting salary for this position is $65,000. DRI offers a benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, and life insurance, 6.2% retirement match, 1.25 annual leave days per month, a beginning balance of 15 sick leave days, 12 paid holidays, educational benefits, and the option to participate in a flexible spending account or health savings account. Additionally, there is no state income tax and no social security deduction. This position may be eligible for relocation assistance dependent on division funding.
 
 
 
  Organizational Summary
 
 
  For more than 60 years, the Desert Research Institute has functioned as the nonprofit, non-degree-granting environmental research arm of the Nevada System of Higher Education. Focused on basic and applied research, the Institute’s unique model blends academia with entrepreneurship to deliver a wide variety of scientific services and research-generated knowledge to its sponsors and clients.
 
 
 
  DRI faculty are nontenured and responsible for generating their own salaries and Institute operating revenues through external funding. DRI also receives a portion of its annual operating revenues from the State of Nevada. As an autonomous organization in NSHE, DRI maintains financial and personnel policies and procedures that differ from other NSHE institutions.

  Loom Video
 Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in-depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40
  Overview
 You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!
  What Will I Be Doing?
 
  Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
  Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
  Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
  We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""Which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.""
 
  Pay Rates
 Compensation rates vary based on location and experience.
 Note: The following rates are starting points and may be subject to change:

   US - 50/hr
   Brazil - 25.40 USD /hr
   Egypt - 14.60 USD /hr
   Philippines - 24.20 USD /hr
  Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hours per week and some working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform.
 
  Contract Length
 
  Long term, there is no end date. They expect to have work for the next 2 years.
  You can end the contract at any time. We hope you will commit to 12 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand.
 
  Flexible Schedules
 
  Developers can set their own hours—ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but they will also be incredibly flexible on working hours.
  You can take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises.
 
  Interview Process
