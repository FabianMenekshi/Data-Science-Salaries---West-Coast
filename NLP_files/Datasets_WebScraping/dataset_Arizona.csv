 The mission of the Technology Community Office is to ensure American Express is positioned as a first-class technology company with a peerless engineering culture. This sees the office encouraging and curating participation in communities both internal and external fostering a sense of belonging among technologists. The office believes strongly in the power of community, not only unlocking the aggregate benefits of collaboration at scale, but the individual benefits that come from being part of a larger whole.
 
 Some of the work of the TCO includes fostering innovation, encouraging participation in open-source communities, helping internal Engineering Guilds flourish, sponsoring community efforts such as conferences, foundations, and software organizations, empowering developers though documentation and content, reaching out to external technologists as ambassadors of American Express, building recognition programs, and gathering community sentiment feedback. Ultimately, the work of the TCO is to encourage and maximize the human side of technology, anywhere people are coming together to do their best work.
  Who are You?

You produce content that is consumed widely, your ideas are discussed and adopted at increasing orbits of influence. You enjoy speaking to large groups and lending your voice in group settings. People have changed the way they think and do work because they spent time with you. Others look to you for understanding and advice.
  You are professionally curious – You bring clarity to the confusing and you thrive on exploration. You seek data to drive your decisions and are ready to learn. You have expertise but it does not constrain you, willing to put forth your best efforts as a “polymath”.

     Position Highlights
    
    
     The Udall Center for Public Policy at the University of Arizona is in search of a Postdoctoral Research Associate. The Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) movement focuses on the protection of Indigenous rights and interests in the control and governance of Indigenous data. Because Indigenous Peoples’ data are largely held by non-Indigenous entities across fields and sectors, targeted mechanisms and tools are needed to reveal inherent biases in data collection, storage, and circulation, and intervene with solutions to advance science in service to communities. The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (IDGov) are a vital tool for asserting sovereignty at multiple scales, from community-led to external funders for data actors engaging with Indigenous data.
     The postdoc will join the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance (Collaboratory), co-leading and contributing to projects and publications related to IDSov and IDGov with a diverse international network. The Collaboratory seeks to foster responsible and respectful knowledge exchange, training, and connections globally for researchers who collect, use, and store Indigenous data. The postdoctoral researcher will also join the team for a new National Science Foundation funded Network-of-Networks (NoN), a collaboration of Indigenous and allied scholars, community leaders, and practitioners spanning IDSov, law, policy, information management, data governance, genome sciences, and the environment. The postdoc will collaborate with experts from University of Arizona, New York University, and University of California Los Angeles, and in partnership with the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) and eleven other IDSov/IDGov related networks to co-create and conduct trainings, resources, and processes for IDGov that are attentive to critical questions informing mainstream research data norms and practices. As a member of the NoN, the postdoc will actively contribute to the growth and maintenance of an international-scale collaboration among GIDA, six national/regional IDSov networks (United States, Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and Sapmí in Norway, Sweden, Finland), and five international IDGov collectives (Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga/New Zealand's Māori Centre of Research Excellence, Local Contexts, the NSF-funded Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledges and Science [CBIKS], the Equity for Indigenous Research and Innovation Coordinating Hub [ENRICH], and the Collaboratory).
     
     Outstanding UA benefits include health, dental, vision, and life insurance; paid vacation, sick leave, and holidays; UA/ASU/NAU tuition reduction for the employee and qualified family members; access to UA recreation and cultural activities; and more!
     The University of Arizona has been recognized for our innovative work-life programs.
    
   
   
    
     Duties & Responsibilities
    
    
     Position Highlights: 
     This position is with the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance, a research network that develops research, policy, and practice innovations for Indigenous Data Sovereignty. The Collaboratory’s research, teaching, and engagement seek to transform institutional governance and ethics for Indigenous control of Indigenous data, particularly within open science, open data, and big data contexts. Administered out of the Udall Center for Studies in Public Policy and its Native Nations Institute (NNI) and the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health at the University of Arizona, this position with the Collaboratory is located within the Udall Center and NNI.
     Specific tasks may include:
     
      Co-lead virtual workshops to develop IDGov guidelines with publishers, university administrations, data repositories, and funding entities.
      Contribute to development of content for the open access, global Indigenous DataSET (Sovereignty and Ethics Training) Hub.

      Manage project evaluations and assessments.
      Develop data infrastructure or tools for the governance of data
      Contribute to the development of IDGov guidelines for diverse data actors and institutions.
      Participate in UArizona Postdoctoral Affairs for training on: how to apply for a faculty position, career paths outside of academia, tips for negotiating salary and start-up funds, and how to plan an independent research agenda.
      Attend regular training events in grantsmanship offered by the UArizona Research Development Office.
      Draft reports and updates for the Udall Center, UArizona, and the National Science Foundation updates, progress, and outputs.
      Prepare manuscripts and policy briefs.
      Present project process and outcomes at professional conferences.
      Develop a professional development plan and meet regularly with mentors.
      Additional duties may be assigned.
     
      Knowledge, skills & abilities:
     
      Knowledge and understanding of quantitative and qualitative research methods.

    <div>
     <p>The Udall Center for Public Policy at the University of Arizona is in search of a Postdoctoral Research Associate. The Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) movement focuses on the protection of Indigenous rights and interests in the control and governance of Indigenous data. Because Indigenous Peoples’ data are largely held by non-Indigenous entities across fields and sectors, targeted mechanisms and tools are needed to reveal inherent biases in data collection, storage, and circulation, and intervene with solutions to advance science in service to communities. The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (IDGov) are a vital tool for asserting sovereignty at multiple scales, from community-led to external funders for data actors engaging with Indigenous data.<br></p>
     <p>The postdoc will join the Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance (Collaboratory), co-leading and contributing to projects and publications related to IDSov and IDGov with a diverse international network. The Collaboratory seeks to foster responsible and respectful knowledge exchange, training, and connections globally for researchers who collect, use, and store Indigenous data. The postdoctoral researcher will also join the team for a new National Science Foundation funded Network-of-Networks (NoN), a collaboration of Indigenous and allied scholars, community leaders, and practitioners spanning IDSov, law, policy, information management, data governance, genome sciences, and the environment. The postdoc will collaborate with experts from University of Arizona, New York University, and University of California Los Angeles, and in partnership with the Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) and eleven other IDSov/IDGov related networks to co-create and conduct trainings, resources, and processes for IDGov that are attentive to critical questions informing mainstream research data norms and practices.</p> As a member of the NoN, the postdoc will actively contribute to the growth and maintenance of an international-scale collaboration among GIDA, six national/regional IDSov networks (United States, Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and Sapmí in Norway, Sweden, Finland), and five international IDGov collectives (Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga/New Zealand's Māori Centre of Research Excellence, Local Contexts, the NSF-funded Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledges and Science [CBIKS], the Equity for Indigenous Research and Innovation Coordinating Hub [ENRICH], and the Collaboratory).<br>

"Republic Services","ABOUT THE COMPANY
 Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.
 
 In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.
 
 Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.
 
 Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.
 
 Our company values guide our daily actions:
 
   Safe: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.
   Committed to Serve: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.
   Environmentally Responsible: We take action to improve our environment.
   Driven: We deliver results in the right way.
   Human-Centered: We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.
 
 
 We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.
 
  STRATEGY
 Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.
 We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.
 With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.
 
  Recycling and Waste
 We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.
 
  Environmental Solutions
 Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.
  SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION
 Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.
 
 The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.
 
 We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.

  Loom Video
 Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in-depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40
  Overview
 You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!
  What Will I Be Doing?
 
  Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
  Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
  Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
  We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""Which piece of Python code is better?"" to ""Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.""
 
  Pay Rates
 Compensation rates vary based on location and experience.
 Note: The following rates are starting points and may be subject to change:

  Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hours per week and some working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform.
 
  Contract Length
 
  Long term, there is no end date. They expect to have work for the next 2 years.
  You can end the contract at any time. We hope you will commit to 12 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand.
 
  Flexible Schedules
 
  Developers can set their own hours—ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but they will also be incredibly flexible on working hours.
  You can take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises.
 
  Interview Process
 
  Apply using this Ashby form.
  If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it.
  You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll then set up a group call to answer any further questions about onboarding with the company.
  You'll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be your final interview, which will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available.
 
  Tech Stack Priorities
 
  The current priority for this team is engineers with either a Data Science background who know Python well or software engineers who are well versed in Python.

"CSTE","Position type: Fellowship, full-time
Position Highlights
Location: Phoenix, AZ
We encourage, but not require, that the fellow will relocate to Arizona, as this will provide a fuller experience and more opportunity for interaction with ADHS staff. However, we are open to a 100% virtual experience should the fellow be located outside Arizona. Regardless of the fellow’s location, many interactions with the supervisor and colleagues will be via video conferencing (as well as shared documents, emails, chat, etc.) as ADHS maintains a highly virtual work environment. If working in person in the Phoenix office, the fellow will be provided a work space.
Compensation: 95,000 plus benefits
Position Type: Full time, limited-term opportunity
Position End Date: June 14, 2025. Funding may be approved for up to 6 additional months beyond the stated project end date of June 14, 2025.
Job description: The fellow will be housed in the Business Intelligence Office in the Division of Public Health Operations. The fellow will be working on projects with both the Informatics section as well as the Data Analytics section of BIO. They will be part of the ongoing project of modernizing the statewide electronic disease surveillance system, MEDSIS. MEDSIS is the surveillance system used for most infectious diseases as well as surveillance for elevated blood lead, opioid overdoses, and birth defect monitoring. The system modernization effort is a broad effort that needs assistance in multiple areas including user acceptance testing, data migration, and planning for additional future enhancements. In addition to the system modernization, the MEDSIS data is also being added to the agency’s data lakehouse. The data lakehouse houses many different public health datasets and improves ease of access to data for end users, improves data governance, and provides a single source of truth for public health data. Adding MEDSIS data to the data lakehouse will improve the interoperability of the data and ease of access for end users. The fellow will assist with the modernization efforts for the MEDSIS application itself, the transition of MEDSIS data to the data lakehouse, the design and build of additional lakehouse tables/views, and facilitating implementation and adoption by lakehouse users.
Another project the fellow may assist with is helping to improve ELR and eCR functionality within the state. The fellow will get experience helping further define and implement a plan for eCR expansion and will participate in developing eCR data governance.
The BIO team will work with the fellow, once selected, to create a roadmap which will assist with the day-to-day activities but the fellow will likely be able to move between projects depending on the current status, needs and interests.

"Republic Services","ABOUT THE COMPANY
 Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.
 
 In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.
 
 Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.
 
 Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.
 
 Our company values guide our daily actions:
 
   Safe: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.
   Committed to Serve: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.
   Environmentally Responsible: We take action to improve our environment.
   Driven: We deliver results in the right way.
   Human-Centered: We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.
 
 
 We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.
 
  STRATEGY
 Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.
 We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.
 With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.
 
  Recycling and Waste
 We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.
 
  Environmental Solutions
 Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.
  SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION
 Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.
 
 The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.
 
 We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.

 <p>Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.</p>
 <p>We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.</p>
 <p>With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b> Recycling and Waste</b></p>
 <p>We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b> Environmental Solutions</b></p>
 <p>Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.</p>
 <p><b><br> SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION</b></p>
 <p>Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.</p>

  An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.
  As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.
